# Project 2

Implement a parser Lisp(ish) in CSharp. 

For this project you will write `lispish.exe`, an parser for a simple LISP-like language. 

Your program will read a LISP expression and print the parse tree.  

## Getting Started
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your fork **FROM WITHIN YOUR DOCKER CONTAINER**
   > Please make sure you have the correct line endings on your files, at this point in the semester you should be able to deal with them. 
3. Type `make update`  to get the latest version of the assignment 
4. Type `make check` to check your work by running the tests
5. Do not submit work that does not pass the checks. 
6. When finished, verify you have `git push`ed your latest changes and then submit a link to your fork when the assignment is done. 

# Overview
Consider the following grammer for a simplified scheme grammar

```
<Program> ::= {<SExpr>}
<SExpr> ::= <Atom> | <List>
<List> ::= () | ( <Seq> )
<Seq> ::= <SExpr> <Seq> | <SExpr>
<Atom> ::= ID | INT | REAL | STRING
```
the symbol `$` denotes an empty string. 

The token types are described by the following regular expressions (use [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) to explore them):

- `INT` = [(?>\+|-)?[0-9]+](https://regex101.com/r/iXVsuF/1)
- `REAL` = [(?>\+|-)?[0-9]*\.[0-9]+](https://regex101.com/r/Zneyy2/1)
- `STRING` = ["(?>\\\\"|.)*"](https://regex101.com/r/dyEpSJ/1)
- `ID` = [[^\\s"\\(\\)]+](https://regex101.com/r/PeL1IV/1/)
- `LITERAL` = [[\\(\\)]](https://regex101.com/r/YTsgaN/1)
- Anythin alse other than whaitespace is an error  
  `ERROR`=  [^\s]

You may use these `Regex` patterns to design your own lexer as we did in the lab, or you can use the C# `Regex.Matches(src)` method to scan the input for matches, taking care to skip whitespace. When designing a tokenizer, the first pattern that matches the input string starting from the current position should be the one that you use.


You may notice that '+', '-', '*',  '/', '=', '<', and '>' are identifiers in our language. 

## Tokenization

Each time your program reads a LISP expression, you will print all of the tokens and lexemes. Each token will be displayed on its own line, the token type will be displayed with a field-width of 20 characters, follows by the lexeme (the text of the token). 



## Parse Tree
You will create a _LispishParser_ class, and also _LispishParser.Node_ class, that represents a node in a parse tree.
Your program will take as input the sourcecode to a LISPish program.  
You will tokenize the sourcecode to produce a sequence of Nodes. 
Then you will write a _Recursive Descent Parser_ that constructs a parse tree.

Similar to our lab, you will define a method named _Node.Print(string prefix)_ within your _Node_ class, that takes a _prefix_ string and then it will print the _Node_'s symbol preceeded by the prefix. Then it will add another two spaces to the prefix string, and recurively call _Print_ for each of it's child nodes. A leaf node (with no children) will display the text of the node instead of displaying its children.  


Please refer to [example1.input](example1.input) and [example1.expected](example1.expected) for examples of the output the should be produced for corresponding input.
